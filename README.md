## Description  
  
A witty slugcat with a progressive Karma:Food:Stats system. Also able to craft tools, and even make shortcuts of its own.  
  
**Controls:** Hold Q to craft. Hold E + direction to tunnel. (tapping the direction is enough, no need to hold)  
  
### Features  
- **Karma/Food/Stats scaling:** Higher Karma translates to higher food requirement. However the more food slugcat eats, the stronger it becomes! Affects things like speed, spear power, and lung capacity.  
- **Crafting:** Holding Q while stationary combines - or dismantles - held items. If nothing is held, it will find (create) a piece of rock. See the crafting recipes below.
- **Tunneling:** Holding E will move the slugcat through a temporary shortcut. It provides only a partial invulnerability, so be careful what you tunnel through!  
  
### Crafting recipes   



## Known Issues & TODO list  
  
- Some images lack flatmode version, others exist in flatmode only.  
- Region is rather a mini-region: needs more rooms.  
- Finishing the game without finishing the quest has been cut for now.  
- Player guide needs upgrade.  
- Iterator deserves a prettier halo and a conversation upgrade (eg. comment on delivering more quest items after finishing already).  
- Region music has been cut. (inspiration: [Ghost Cop - Just run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJRGnA-dSQw))  
  
## Acknowledgements  
  
This mod uses [SlugBase](https://github.com/SlimeCubed/SlugBase) for slugcat's basic framework.  
Special thanks go to [IteratorKit](https://github.com/Twofour2/IteratorKit) for enabling the regions Iterator.  
  
## Source Code  
  
The code of all modules is open-source. Main code is in this repository, however the region and the forked IteratorKit are separated:
